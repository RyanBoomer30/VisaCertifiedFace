# VisaCertifiedFace

As Vietnamâ€™s banking industry started to convert fully online, the demand for efficient personal information detection software is high. I am contributing to this grand project by developing an AI model that can detect whether the image of a VISA or Passport is fake or not. This neural network model can detect **90%** of fake images with an equal **error rate of 1.1**. This is a work in progress and I plan to keep improving it in the coming year.
